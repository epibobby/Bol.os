It is the fourth Columbia Pictures film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and the first film in a rebooted Spider-Man film franchise. Originally, Spider-Man 4 was planned for release in 2011; however, in 2010 the film was cancelled due to Sam Raimi's withdrawal from the project, as he felt he could not meet the planned release date without sacrificing artistic integrity. Sony announced that the franchise will in turn be rebooted with new director Marc Webb and a new cast that includes Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors. The reboot's intention is to have Peter Parker back to developing his abilities in high school.
