It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. The film is an exploration of urban spaces in major cities and the type that inhabits them, and a fluid discussion with renowned designers about their work, the creative process, and the choices and aesthetics behind their use of type.","released":"2007-09-12","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":135,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/dDunHTyTSL1k5u1U5nWjLwzsdVg.jpg","id":"4ea65b3da34d4b4a4f0014bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":226,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/dDunHTyTSL1k5u1U5nWjLwzsdVg.jpg","id":"4ea65b3da34d4b4a4f0014bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":272,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/dDunHTyTSL1k5u1U5nWjLwzsdVg.jpg","id":"4ea65b3da34d4b4a4f0014bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":503,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/dDunHTyTSL1k5u1U5nWjLwzsdVg.jpg","id":"4ea65b3da34d4b4a4f0014bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":735,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/dDunHTyTSL1k5u1U5nWjLwzsdVg.jpg","id":"4ea65b3da34d4b4a4f0014bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1000,"width":680,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/dDunHTyTSL1k5u1U5nWjLwzsdVg.jpg","id":"4ea65b3da34d4b4a4f0014bf"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/1Hm13ov2iyZiDqUBs16dLcdnqp3.jpg","id":"4ea65b39a34d4b4a4f0014bb"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/1Hm13ov2iyZiDqUBs16dLcdnqp3.jpg","id":"4ea65b39a34d4b4a4f0014bb"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/1Hm13ov2iyZiDqUBs16dLcdnqp3.jpg","id":"4ea65b39a34d4b4a4f0014bb"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1Hm13ov2iyZiDqUBs16dLcdnqp3.jpg","id":"4ea65b39a34d4b4a4f0014bb"}}],"version":329,"last_modified_at":"2012-04-11 19:03:33 UTC"}]
