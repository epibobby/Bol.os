The pursuit ended on May 27, 1941, in a battle that plunged the Bismarck into waters nearly three miles deep, taking with it more than 2,000 lives. Almost half a century later, explorer and scientist Dr. Robert Ballard, who discovered the sunken Titanic, searched the Atlantic for the infamous Bismarck. On June 8, 1989, he located the sunken ship, 600 miles off the coast of France. National Geographic looks back at the first, and last, mission of the Bismarck and talks with survivors of the notorious World War II battle. Then, in its climatic chapter, the story reveals exclusive footage of this remarkable undersea exploration.","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/8wkhTrBctL6Beadr5xbd5iTzE9R.jpg","id":"4ea6720e2c058837cb00b125"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/8wkhTrBctL6Beadr5xbd5iTzE9R.jpg","id":"4ea6720e2c058837cb00b125"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/8wkhTrBctL6Beadr5xbd5iTzE9R.jpg","id":"4ea6720e2c058837cb00b125"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":483,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/8wkhTrBctL6Beadr5xbd5iTzE9R.jpg","id":"4ea6720e2c058837cb00b125"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":705,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/8wkhTrBctL6Beadr5xbd5iTzE9R.jpg","id":"4ea6720e2c058837cb00b125"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":975,"width":691,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/8wkhTrBctL6Beadr5xbd5iTzE9R.jpg","id":"4ea6720e2c058837cb00b125"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":165,"last_modified_at":"2012-04-09 14:56:45 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"宇宙戦艦ヤマト","name":"Space Battleship Yamato","alternative_name":"Space Battleship Yamato: The Movie","movie_type":"movie","id":48101,"imdb_id":"tt0204704","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/48101","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":null,"overview":"When vile aliens known as the Gamilons wreak nuclear havoc on Earth, a group of survivors refit the Japanese battleship Yamato for intergalactic travel and set off on a mission to retrieve a neutralizer that will eradicate the radiation from Earth's atmosphere.","released":"1977-08-06","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/4ILRiZB5uq1lpuh6TTbPaWcWyOY.jpg","id":"4ea692a29dc3d83c3b00b903"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/4ILRiZB5uq1lpuh6TTbPaWcWyOY.jpg","id":"4ea692a29dc3d83c3b00b903"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/4ILRiZB5uq1lpuh6TTbPaWcWyOY.jpg","id":"4ea692a29dc3d83c3b00b903"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":482,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/4ILRiZB5uq1lpuh6TTbPaWcWyOY.jpg","id":"4ea692a29dc3d83c3b00b903"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":705,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/4ILRiZB5uq1lpuh6TTbPaWcWyOY.jpg","id":"4ea692a29dc3d83c3b00b903"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":939,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/4ILRiZB5uq1lpuh6TTbPaWcWyOY.jpg","id":"4ea692a29dc3d83c3b00b903"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":168,"last_modified_at":"2012-04-09 17:52:40 UTC"}]
