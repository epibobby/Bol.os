    \def COMMUNI_VERSION

    This macro expands a numeric value of the form 0xMMNNPP (MM = major, NN = minor, PP = patch) that specifies Communi's version number.
    For example, if you compile your application against Communi 1.2.3, the COMMUNI_VERSION macro will expand to 0x010203.

    You can use COMMUNI_VERSION to use the latest Communi features where available. For example:
    \code
#if COMMUNI_VERSION >= 0x000300
    // SSL support since version 0.3.0
    session->setSocket(new QSslSocket(session));
#endif
    \endcode

/*!
    \def COMMUNI_VERSION_STR

    This macro expands to a string that specifies Communi's version number (for example, "1.2.3").
    This is the version against which the application is compiled.
