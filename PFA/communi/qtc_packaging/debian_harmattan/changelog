communi (1.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed issue #11: Copy and paste is not supported
  * Fixed issue #10: Hardcoded channel types. The channel types/prefixes
    are no more hardcoded to "#" and "&" but appropriate channel types
    supported by the network are parsed from the RPL_ISUPPORT message
  * Remember entered channel passwords so that they don't have to be
    entered all over again every time upon connection
  * Fixed issue #9: Background image moves together with VKB
  * Fixed issue #8: Communi prints the WHO list output in the current
    window if some other client connected to the same psyBNC instance
    requests it
  * Fixed issue #7: Option to disable auto-connect on application start
  * Refactored (versioned) the settings system. NOTE: this version
    is incompatible with previous versions -> connections must be
    re-entered. This is no more necessary in the future when stored
    settings change, thanks to the versioning...
