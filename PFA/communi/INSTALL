Build config
------------
The default build config is resolved by qmake. To build Communi
specifically in release or debug mode, you may pass additional
"-config release" or "-config debug" parameters to qmake, respectively.
Furthermore, in order to build a static version of Communi, you
may pass "-config static".

ICU support
-----------
ICU support is enabled by default. If you do not have ICU installed or if you
want to disable the ICU support for other reasons, you may pass additional
"-config no_icu" parameters to qmake.

Example
-------
A static library in release mode, without ICU support:
qmake -confit static -config release -config no_icu
